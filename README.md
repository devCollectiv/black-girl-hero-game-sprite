# Black Girl Hero Game Sprite

In the process of preparing to help teach a course on game development for [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/), I went in search of a sprite of a Black girl for the hero character. After searching several sprite sites, I found none. So, I hired [a designer](http://musiamure.daportfolio.com/) to create one.

## What you need to know

* There is a hero and a baddie both with and without grounding shadows.
* The hero is centered in a frame that’s 69x92px. The baddie’s is 59x68px.
* The hero has 4 states: left, down, right, up. The baddie has 2 states: eye open, eye closed.

Here is a demo with the art in place in a [simple game](http://segdeha.com/bgc/mygame/) based on work by [Catt Small](https://twitter.com/cattsmall). See the characters with grounding shadows by appending [?shadows](http://segdeha.com/bgc/mygame/?shadows) to the URL.
